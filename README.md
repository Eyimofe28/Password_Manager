# Password Manager

## Project Overview

This project is a Python-based password manager with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. The application allows users to generate secure passwords, save them along with website and email information, and store them in a local file. The generated passwords are automatically copied to the clipboard for easy use.

## Features

1. **Password Generation**: Generate secure passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
2. **Password Storage**: Save website, email, and password information to a local file.
3. **Clipboard Integration**: Automatically copy the generated password to the clipboard for easy pasting.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)
- Pyperclip (for clipboard functionality)
- Random (for generating random passwords)

## File Descriptions

### `main.py`

This file contains the main logic and GUI setup for the password manager application. It includes functions for generating passwords, saving passwords, and setting up the user interface.

### `logo.png`

An image file used as the logo for the application, displayed in the GUI.

### `data.txt`

A text file where the saved password information is stored. Each entry includes the website, email, and password.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are installed. You can install `pyperclip` using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pyperclip
   ```

3. **Run the Project**: Execute the `main.py` file to start the application.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Generate Password**: Click the "Generate Password" button to create a new password. The generated password will be automatically copied to the clipboard.
2. **Save Information**: Enter the website, email/username, and password. Click the "Save Info!" button to save the information to `data.txt`.
3. **Clipboard Integration**: The generated password will be automatically copied to the clipboard for easy use.

## Code Explanation

### Password Generation

The `generate_password` function creates a secure password using a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. The password is copied to the clipboard and displayed in the password entry field.

### Saving Password

The `save` function validates the input fields and saves the website, email, and password information to `data.txt`. If any field is empty, it shows an error message.


### UI Setup

The UI setup uses Tkinter to create the main window, labels, entry fields, and buttons.
